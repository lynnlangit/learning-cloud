# 3 Steps To Get Started in Cloud--->


1. 🤔 **READ this Repo** and FAQ
    - this repo is a companion to my **'Cloud Careers and Certifications`** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cloud-computing-careers-and-certifications-first-steps-14851328) course on LinkedIn Learning or Lynda.com course.  It is designed to be a first course for those who are new working with public cloud services
    - ❓ FAQ - here are the top 10 questions students ask about `learning-cloud` - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud/tree/master/CLOUD-PATTERNS/0_Starting-Points)
2. 🤔 **SELECT a cloud vendor** (AWS, GCP...), set up a free trial (test) account for learning
    - See the main file in each vendor folders for links
      - for **AWS** go to `\AWS` folder -> `README.md`
      - for **GCP** go to `\GCP` folder -> `README.md`, etc...
    - Set up **MFA (multi-factor authentication)** on the root user account for your trial cloud account to protect against account misuse by others
      - setup up MFA on AWS root user account - [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html) 
      - setup MFA on GCP user accounts - [link](https://www.trendmicro.com/cloudoneconformity/knowledge-base/gcp/CloudIAM/enable-mfa-for-user-accounts.html)

3. 💸 **SECURE and SETUP a budget alert** on your test account - I suggest alerting on spend of over $ 50 USD per day
    - follow **best practices** for security a demo account (AWS example) - [link](https://dev.to/aws-heroes/stop-aws-account-hacks-1bim)
