## How to Start

1. REVIEW - this Repo is a companion to my **'Cloud Careers and Certifications`** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cloud-computing-careers-and-certifications-first-steps-2) course on LinkedIn Learning or Lynda.com course.  It is designed to be a first course for those who are new working with public cloud services.
2. SELECT a **cloud vendor** (AWS, GCP...), set up a free trial (test) account for learning
  - See the main file in each vendor folders for links
  - for **AWS** go to `\AWS` folder -> `README.md`
  - for **GCP** go to `\GCP` folder -> `README.md`, etc...
  - more about vendor differences - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud/blob/master/VENDORS.md)
3. SETUP a **budget alert** on your test account - I suggest alerting on spend of over $ 50 USD per day
4. SELECT a **scenario** or service to start learning
5. BUILD and Learn...repeat!
